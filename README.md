# Market-Segmentation-Case-Study

Welcome to the 2nd Project during my internship at Feynn Labs which is based on the Market Segmentation of Online Cab Booking System.

For this I obtained the data from Kaggle Competitions and UCI Repositories (other google searches). As the datasets are too large I shared the link for the datasets in the report that I uploaded in this repository.

Pls go through the links for the dataset and the report for the insights on the code.

Happy Learning! :)
